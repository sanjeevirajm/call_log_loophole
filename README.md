# Simple Caller ID App
Read about implementing caller id in the dialer app itseld. On seeing the source code, there is no READ_CALL_LOG permission and it works.
It uses ContactsContract.PhoneLookup class. I have forked the project and modified to a lot to just show POC of accesing call logs without permission.
